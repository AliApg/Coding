Asteraceae provides coffee substitutes, herbal teas, sweetening agents, artichokes, sunflower seeds, leaf vegetables, and cooking oils. Plants of Asteraceae with commercial importance include Lactuca sativa, Cynara cardunculus, Carthamus tinctorius (safflower), Smallanthus sonchifolius, Helianthus annuus (sunflower), and so on. Many bioactive compounds including essential oils, polysaccharides, flavonoids, clerodane-type diterpenes, triterpenoid saponines, phenols, salicylic acid derivatives, occur in Asteraceae, and have many biological activities, such as gastroprotective, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, and antimicrobial effects. Diuretic activities have been linked with leiocarposide and flavonoids, while anti-inflammatory effects are attributed to phenolic compounds such as leiocarposide, hyperoside, quercitrin, and so on. Cytotoxic activities could be attributed to the terpenic compounds. The energy store in Asteraceae mostly exists as inulin. Asteraceae produces tannins, acetylenes, alkaloids, iso/chlorogenic acid, pentacyclic triterpene alcohols, sesquiterpene lactones, and so on. Most of the substances have promising potential in medicine, diet, and therapeutics. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Exploiting this redundancy by image data compression allows the recording of these television signals on a digital VTR whose data rate is chosen to provide optimum performance and is less than the input image data rate. Almost transparent results can be achieved when a sophisticated compression scheme and mild compression ratios are used. The recorder data channel differs from the conventional digital VTR channel significantly in order to process the signal in which the image redundancy has been removed without any defects. Powerful forward error correction is employed. The tape media used requires special attention during the manufacturing process to eliminate the causes of surface debris that could produce momentary head clogs that may possibly exceed the error correction range. Automatic systems are used to ensure perfect insert editing under all environmental and interchange conditions. © 1994 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc.","","Error correction; Image compression; Image recording; Data-rate; Image data; Image data compression; Information contents; Input image; Magnetic medium; Optimum performance; Signal-on; Television images; Television signals; Redundancy","","","","","","","Helical-scan Digital Composite Video Cassette Recording System Using 19 Magnetic Tape, Format D2 (NTSC, PAL, PAL-M); Davies D., Stabilitv of Metal Particle Tapes.

However, the scalability and efficiency challenges faced by traditional blockchain consensus algorithms have hindered widespread adoption. Consensus algorithms play a crucial role in achieving agreement among network participants regarding the validity and ordering of transactions. Traditional consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) have shown limitations in terms of their resource-intensive nature, slow transaction processing, and limited scalability. This paper presents efficiency and scalability is critical considerations in blockchain consensus algorithms. The utilization of checkpoint mechanisms offers promising avenues for enhancing the performance of consensus protocols.

The central piece of equipment is the 'frame-buffer,' a memory which stores an entire rgb picture, has a video output port and a port for random access by computer. -NYIT has undertaken a considerable software effort to make that hardware useable in a production environment. The programs developed thus far give us the capability to 'paint' backgrounds, to color animated figures, create special effects, combine images, change scanned-in images, and digitally synthesize or modify a broad class of images. Our focus has been on 2-d animation. Having made substantial gains in solving problems in that area we are currently adapting the programs for production. -The researchers have paid considerable attention to the technical problems of aliasing, color control and image quality. In addition they are now focusing on 3-d animation. -The work has not been without difficulties. Digitally synthesized pictures can take from 15 seconds to 2 minutes to create using a general purpose computer. In addition, once a program is developed, it must be moved out of a research environment and into a production one. -The NYIT system of hardware and software has been successfully used to make an animated film, some test commercials and animated sequences to demonstrate the power and versatility of the system. We have been able to produce some astonishing results. © 1979 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc.","","General purpose computers; Motion pictures; Random access storage; Software testing; Video signal processing; Aliasing; Broadcast quality; Computer scientists; Frame buffer; Framebuffer; Output ports; Production environments; Random access; Software effort; Video output; Animation","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","13th SMPTE Television Conference on Digital Video","3 February 1979","San Francisco","122065","","978-161482908-9","","","English","SMPTE Telev.
